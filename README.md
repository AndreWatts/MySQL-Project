# World Data Exploration with SQL

## Overview 🌍

Welcome to the World Data Exploration repository! In this project, we embark on a journey through a comprehensive world dataset, gaining profound insights using SQL queries. The exploration involves leveraging various SQL statements to extract meaningful information from the dataset. Additionally, we have crafted an Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) that identifies primary keys and foreign keys, shedding light on the intricate relationships within the data.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset under scrutiny encompasses a rich array of global information, ranging from geographical details to demographic statistics. This dataset serves as a treasure trove of knowledge about our diverse world.

## SQL Queries 📜

### Query Highlights

- **Basic Queries:**
  - Utilized `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` statements to filter and retrieve specific data points.
  - Employed aggregate functions and grouping to derive insightful summaries.

- **Advanced Queries:**
  - Formulated complex queries involving multiple tables using `JOIN` statements.
  - Explored subqueries to gain nuanced insights into the relationships within the dataset.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) 📊

To visually represent the data structure, an Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) has been meticulously crafted. This diagram serves as a blueprint, illustrating the primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between entities within the dataset.
